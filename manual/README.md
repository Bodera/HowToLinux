# Manual
The Debian project is well documented so I read the docs like instructed by the prhase "Read the fancy manual".

## What do you will find here?
Code samples applying what is teatched in the docs, following good practices and avoiding silly misguidance.

## May can you help?
Of course, if you notice some old statement, or perhaps a tip, you can open an issue.
